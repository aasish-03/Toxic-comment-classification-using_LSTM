# Toxic-comment-classification using LSTM

This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify comments into different categories (e.g., spam, hate speech, or sentiment analysis). 

The model processes text data and predicts the label associated with each comment.The objective of this project is to classify user-generated comments using an LSTM neural network. LSTM models are effective in sequence-based data such as text, as they can capture long-term dependencies.
